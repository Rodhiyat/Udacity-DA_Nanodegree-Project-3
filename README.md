## Summary of Findings

> Not all applicants are emloyed. For defaulters, majority of the loan types given to them fall under the category of poorly rated loans, with only very few of them given highly rated loans. Majority of the loan applicants with employed status income range are from 100k and greater. The distribution of amount loaned of applicants is right skewed because there are few applicants with high loan demand. LoanStatus with "current" and "completed" have their own homes as at when they applied for loans, "Professional" as an occupation had the highest number of defaulters.Based on the ratio of defaulters to the ratio of loan recepients RD and SI states are the most likely to default payment. The major reason for loan collection by most of the applicants was for "Debt Consolidation" by a great amount, this may need to be looked at.



## Key Insights for Presentation

> I want to look at the factors or features that had an effect on the amount loaned out. I also wanted to know the various people who were most likely to default a loan payment. For simplicity of the visualization I have looked at only few variables. The main dataframe was broken down into various data set through the projects for simplicity and for easy analysis
